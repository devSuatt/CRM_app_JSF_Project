# CRM_app_JSF_Project

<strong>Note: </strong> We developed this project together with my group friends as a school project in the 2nd grade in 2019.

* We used glassfish as the web server.

* The files required with .xhtml extension for the development of the frontend are in the web folder.

* We used the MVC pattern in the development process.
